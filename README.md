# MyPlot
### **Create, manage, and build in protected plots. Keep your builds safe from griefers!**

Have you ever seen those Java servers with the PlotMe plugin and thought "Hey, why can't I have plots on my Minecraft server?" Well, now you can with **MyPlot** for PocketMine-MP!

A list of commands and permissions can be found in the [MyPlot Wiki](http://jasonwynn10.github.io/MyPlot/cmdsandperms) along with a helpful config guide [here](http://jasonwynn10.github.io/MyPlot/configurations).

### *NOTE:* MyPlot is designed to only support pmmp's version of the PocketMine-MP server software and will not work with any other third party build.
